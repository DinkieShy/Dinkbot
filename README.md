# Dinkbot

This is the source code behind my discord bot, Dinkbot!
It's based mostly around my own server and some features won't work if it's ported to another, but if you're interested in making a discord bot, head over to https://discord.js.org/#/ and check out the API. If you're not familiar with JavaScript and for some reason this stops you trying, other languages are available, such as Python, so definitely give it a go!

This is a really short readme because Dinkbot's always changing and I don't think I could keep up with all the features and changes, all the 'important' stuff (important meaning: "Stuff written by *me*") is in bot.js. If you were to look in the event handler for 'client.on("message",...' you'll find all the commands people on Discord can enter. There's also some stuff that happens automatically in the background, so really just look around. If something doesn't make sense and you're interested, feel free to get in touch!

(Also, if you try downloading this as is and find it doesn't run, it's because you'll need to create a file called "auth.json" and put inside '{"token":"insert your bot auth token from https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro here"}'. I haven't added my own file here because you should keep it as secret as possible!)

Good luck and enjoy my code!
